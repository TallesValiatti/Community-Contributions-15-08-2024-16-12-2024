At **Data Saturday Vitória 2024**, I had the privilege of delivering a presentation on **"Creating SQL Queries with Semantic Kernel."**

During this session, I showcased how to leverage OpenAI's **4.0 Mini model** to generate SQL queries with enhanced accuracy and contextual relevance. The presentation focused on the practical application of AI to streamline and improve database interactions, enabling developers and data professionals to craft smarter and more efficient solutions.

The highlight of the session was a **live demo**, where I demonstrated the model's capabilities in real time, allowing attendees to see firsthand how AI can transform the process of creating and optimizing SQL queries.

We concluded with an engaging Q&A, discussing the potential of AI-driven tools in modern database management and exploring innovative ways to integrate these technologies into everyday workflows.
